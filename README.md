## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Docker installed (optional for Docker setup)
- MongoDB connection string added to a `.env` file

### Add MongoDB Connection String

- For **Running without Docker** and **Running with Docker (Without Docker Compose)**, the `.env` file must be placed in the `backend` folder with the following format:

  ```
  MONGO_URL = your-mongodb-connection-string
  ```

- For **Docker Compose**, the `.env` file must be placed in the root directory of the project.

## Running the Application

There are three ways to run this application:

### 1. Running Without Docker

1. **Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### 2. Running with Docker (Without Docker Compose)

#### Step 1: Create a Docker Network
```bash
docker network create mern_net
```

#### Step 2: Build and Run the Client

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder and build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   docker build -t frontend:v1 -f Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Run the frontend container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name=client --network=mern_net -p 5173:5173 frontend:v1
   ```

3. To stop the container:
   ```bash
   docker stop client
   ```

4. To restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker start client
   ```

#### Step 3: Build and Run the Server

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder and build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker build -t backend:v1 -f Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Run the backend container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name=server --network=mern_net -p 4000:4000 backend:v1
   ```

3. To stop the container:
   ```bash
   docker stop server
   ```

4. To restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker start server
   ```

### 3. Running with Docker Compose

1. Navigate to the `MERN-University-app` root folder.

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. To stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
